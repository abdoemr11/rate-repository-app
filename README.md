# Part 1
- After reinstalling windows and playing with diskpart, here we go again.  
- nvm is a nice little thing to know.

# Part 2
- I used ChatGpt to create the RepositoryItem. I was only need to convert the repository object data to boilerplate code but I don't know if this is considered cheating. Carefull next time!. 
- It seems it's not. I thought that chatGpt was only copying from model solution. I'm sorry ChatGpt.

# Part 3 
- As I far I understand now. We are able to to use a simple get request along graphql because in the api repo they built the express app first then passed it to the graphql server. this way the original app is still there. 
- Because in react native the main entry file is App.js we will all the nasty stuff there like NativeRouter or enclosing apolloClient tags.
- I faced weired bug. and it was solved by replacing localhost with actual ipv4 network ip.
- With AsyncStorage no need to handle state because it is global by default.
