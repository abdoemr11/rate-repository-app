# Part 1
- After reinstalling windows and playing with diskpart, here we go again.  
- nvm is a nice little thing to know.

# Part 2
- I used ChatGpt to create the RepositoryItem. I was only need to convert the repository object data to boilerplate code but I don't know if this is considered cheating. Carefull next time!. 
- It seems it's not. I thought that chatGpt was only copying from model solution. I'm sorry ChatGpt.
